# contributed) code to the ADMML repository.  The AUTHORS file lists
# the copyright holders; this file lists people.  For example, Robert Bosch
# LLC's employees are listed here but not in AUTHORS, because Robert Bosch
# LLC holds the copyright.

# written in certain circumstances, so please do due diligence to ensure that
# you have the right to submit the code.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file, either J's name or J's
# organization's name should be added to the AUTHORS file, depending on
# whether J's employer (or academic institution) claims ownership over code
# that is written for this project.
